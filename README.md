# tcpip_stack
Implement your own TCP IP Stack

In this course, We shall be implementing a Working and Minimal TCP/IP Stack through several Networking Projects. Below is the list of projects Implemented so far.

Visit : www.csepracticals.com for more projects and courses.

Project 1 : Build a MultiNode Topology Emulation of Routers and Switches

Project 2 : Implement DataLink Layer (L2 routing), including ARP

Project 3 : Implement L2 Switching (Mac-based Learning and Forwarding)

Project 4 : Implement Vlan Based Mac learning and Forwarding

Project 5 : Implement Network Layer (L3 routing)

Project 6 : Implement Access Control List from Scratch

Project 7 : Implement Prefix List for Route Selection & Import / Export Policies

Project 8 : Implement support for Network Object Groups

Project 9 : Implement a prototype of a routing protocol ( IGP )

Project 10 : GRE Tunnel Support

After Doing These Projects, you shall be able to :

Tell why you need Data link layer and Network Layer
How to design a new Application protocol on a TCP/IP stack (just like ICMP, HTTP, etc all work on TCP/IP Stack)
Get your hands dirty with industry-level network programming.
Learn cooking up, parsing and reading the packet buffers
Understand End-To-End Architecture and Design of Network Application and TCP/IP Stack
Conquer Interviews for the role of Network Developer Engineer
Decorate your GitHub, and add a strong project to your HAT, Expected LOCs of this course shall exceed 70k !
This project will fill up the gap between theoretical knowledge and the Implementation version of it. How does it sound that you have written code by your own hands to resolve ARP, packet forwarding, etc. Decorate your resume and GitHub with this project.
